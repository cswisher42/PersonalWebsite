<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Greetings, my name is Chuck Swisher and I am from Kansas City, Kansas. As a child (at least more of one than I am now), 
I always found myself most interested in science fiction movies and books than any other genre. I believe that a large 
part of who I am can be attributed to those books and movies because the feats of technology displayed made me wish to be 
one of the people who brought their made up gadgets into the real world. As I continued to grow, computers caught my 
attention and I soon started telling my parents and others how to operate their different pieces of technology, as I am 
sure it was/is for most computer science majors. I quickly discovered that I liked working with computers and their many 
different applications and I was decided that I would work with them.</p>
<h2>Why I Chose K-State</h2>
<p>Fast forward to the end of high school and I now was in a position to make my first real, meaningful decision about 
how to pursue my goal. As the process of school selection began it was readily apparent that Kansas State's College of 
Engineering had a reputation of producing work ready engineers and having a high return on investment. Being an adequate 
distance from home and having quality scholarships available it was not a very hard decision to select my destination of 
Manhattan. After hearing about the Scholars program and all of the clubs and activities available, I was more than certain 
that I wanted to come to <b>K-State.</b> Additionally, several of my good friends from high school are here at K-State as well. 
My not having to completely start over as far as friends and acquaintances are concerned was a nice added bonus to the deal.</p>
<h3>A Breif Job History</h3>
<p>While still in the eastern part of the state, I was fortunate enough to land a job at a LAN center close to where I lived. 
At first, I was just there as a customer, enjoying being in what I consider to be a unique place: a place where everyone is 
their because they want to play video games. After spending all of my money and time there, I became friends with the workers 
and owners of the store. Every once in awhile, one of them would ask me to do something to help out and I was eventually 
brought on officially. In short, I was a cashier and an IT worker. When the client we used to keep track of the time a person 
had played stopped working or Steam wouldnâ€™t launch a game for whatever reason, I would have the wonderfully nerve wracking 
task of troubleshooting a problem as quickly as possible, sometimes under the glare of a disgruntled customer that had <i>no idea 
how a computer worked.</i> Fortunately, I can say that most of the time it was quite an enjoyable experience talking about the 
latest games and the new meta with the friends I had made there or the customers that would come in.</p>
<h4>How I Learn About Technology</h4>
<p>The exposure that I have had to more advanced topics often has come from Reddit's [/r/technology](www.reddit.com/r/technology)
subreddit. Typically speaking I mainly get the basic details before from post titles or users posts before exploring further on 
my own in places like [Popular Mechanics](www.popularmechanics.com), [Time](www.time.com), or [Forbes](www.forbes.com). If a 
subject is particularly interesting to me, I will delve even further going to places like <u>google scholar</u> and attempting to decipher
the paper to the best of my ability.</p>
